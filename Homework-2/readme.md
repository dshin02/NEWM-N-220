# Assignment 2: Working Scripts

## Week 2 Lecture
This assignment demonstrates the implementation of inline and external JavaScript scripts, as well as the use of the browser console for debugging and interaction.

## Weekly Recap
### Key Takeaways
1. **Browser Console**:
   - Useful for debugging JavaScript using methods like `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error`.
   - Different shortcuts for opening DevTools across browsers (e.g., `Ctrl + Option + C` for Safari).

2. **Data Types**:
   - Commonly used: `String` ("This is an example), `Number`(12, 21), and `Boolean`(true).
   - Strings are enclosed in quotes, numbers are used for calculations, and booleans are used for logic.

3. **Scripts**:
   - **Inline Scripts**: Added directly within `<script>` tags in the HTML.
   - **External Scripts**: Stored in `.js` files and linked via `<script src>`.

## Notes for Future Reference
- **console.log**: Logs general information, ideal for debugging.
- **console.warn**: Highlights potential issues.
- **console.error**: Used to flag errors for immediate attention.
- Use **inline scripts** for quick tests and **external scripts** for organized code in larger projects.
